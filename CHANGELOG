Stable v1.0 24.04.2019
----
Comments:
- All tasks from web API work in parallel
- Foreman servers parsing tasks run in async mode, one host - one thread. Inside thread if retrieved items from page > `API.get_per_page` it's starting another new thread[s] on each `API.get_per_page`.
Features:
- Collect data from target Foreman's in to own db
- Provide support to Creating/Updating/Deleting Host Groups
- Storing Host Groups as JSON files on host
